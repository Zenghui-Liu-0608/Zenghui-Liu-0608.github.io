    你好, Hello, こんにちは, Bonjour, Привет, Hallo, مرحبا, नमस्ते, 안녕하세요, Ciao.
  I'm Liu Zenghui. I am currently completing my master's studies at the <a href="https://tiei2014.tju.edu.cn/">School of Future Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn">Tianjin University</a>, primarily engaged in fire dynamics, building fire analysis, and intelligent fire protection. The supervisor of my master's program is Professor <a href="https://arch.tju.edu.cn/info/1186/3163.htm/">Gang Liu</a>.  Between October 2022 and July 2023, I conducted one-year research on the spatiotemporal prediction of infection risks in waiting rooms as a research assistant. In the future, I will devote myself to research on resilience, sustainability, and equity of complex urban systems. I am also a student member of the Architectural Society of China, the Fire Engineers Association, the International Society for Urban Information, and the International Building Performance Simulation Association. I also serve as a peer reviewer for journals such as Humanities and Social Sciences Communications and Journal of Safety Science and Resilience. Since April 2025, I have been on probation as a young editorial board member of <a href="https://press.jandoo.ac">Jandoo press</a> <a href="https://press.jandoo.ac/journals/jsbe/">Journal of Sustainable Built Environment (JSBE)</a>.
   In my spare time, I play basketball, table tennis, Guan Dan (a kind of card game), listen to music, and play the guitar (for indie music lovers).
