    你好, Hello, こんにちは, Bonjour, Привет, Hallo, مرحبا, नमस्ते, 안녕하세요, Ciao.
  I'm Liu Zenghui. I am currently completing my master's studies at the <a href="https://tiei2014.tju.edu.cn/">School of Future Technology</a>, <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn">Tianjin University</a>, primarily engaged in fire dynamics, building fire analysis, and intelligent fire protection. Previously, I conducted a one-year research on the spatiotemporal prediction of infection risks in waiting rooms. In the future, I will devote myself to the research on resilience, sustainability, and equity of urban complex systems. Additionally, I am currently a student member of the Architectural Society of China, the Fire Engineers Association, and the International Building Performance Simulation Association. I also serve as a peer reviewer for journals such as Humanities and Social Sciences Communications and Journal of Safety Science and Resilience.
   In my spare time, I play basketball, table tennis, Guan Dan (a kind of card game), listen to music, and play the guitar (for indie music lovers).
