 We used machine learning to analyze over 100,000 residential fire incidents in the UK and identified the true drivers of fire spread. The results showed that the most crucial factor was the emergency response stage - such as delayed alarm, time of discovery, etc., accounting for approximately half of the risk impact. The second was the fire dynamics characteristics (such as rapid growth, kitchen fires), accounting for about 30%. The attributes of buildings and people overall have a significant weight, but they can amplify the risk in specific situations. Based on this, resources should be prioritized towards "earlier detection + faster response": optimizing the deployment of fire-fighting forces, upgrading alarm/detection technologies, and building intelligent monitoring platforms to improve the efficiency of early warning and response.
