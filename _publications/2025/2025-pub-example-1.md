 This study examines the role of biomass co-firing retrofitting in coal plants as part of the low-carbon transition, focusing on its employment effects, carbon emissions, and social benefits. Using an integrated model, the research finds that when the biomass blend rate exceeds 90%, job creation shifts, but the overall impact is negative, suggesting biomass co-firing is ineffective for achieving a just transition during coal phase-out and is less competitive than renewable energy. Additionally, generation efficiency decreases linearly with higher blend rates, while carbon emission intensity and job intensity are positively correlated. The study concludes that biomass co-firing is insufficient for a just transition and recommends regionally adaptive blend ratios for optimal performance.
