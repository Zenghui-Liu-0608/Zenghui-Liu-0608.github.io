 This paper examines the impact of sustainable policies in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area on Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), using the Den-en-toshi Line as an example. It evaluates the sustainability of 27 stations using the Node-Place-Ecology (NPE) model. The findings indicate varying adaptability of stations to policy changes. The study also discusses how policy implementation affects station sustainability and offers specific recommendations for different stations to enhance their sustainability.
