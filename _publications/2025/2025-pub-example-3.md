 This study focuses on predicting fire temperature fields in critical evacuation areas of underground exhibition spaces. By combining distributed fiber optic sensors with FDS simulations, a comprehensive temperature database was established, revealing the significant influence of spatial layout and height on temperature distribution. A random forest model with 41 input features demonstrated the highest accuracy in forecasting evacuation-relevant temperature fields. The findings offer valuable technical support for optimizing evacuation strategies and emergency fire response.
