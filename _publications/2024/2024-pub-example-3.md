  This study combines distributed fiber optic temperature sensing systems with deep learning algorithms to develop a dual-agent intelligent fire detection method for rapidly and accurately predicting key fire information in large commercial spaces, including the location of the fire source, the intensity of fire development, and the distribution of carbon monoxide on critical planes. This work not only improves the accuracy and response speed of fire alarms but also provides data support for emergency evacuation and rescue operations, reducing casualties and property loss caused by fires, and has significant practical importance for the safety protection systems of modern commercial buildings.
