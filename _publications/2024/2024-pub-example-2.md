 The innovation of this study is to generate infection risk map by intelligent method and manage the system, so as to achieve accurate control of airborne infection risk in waiting room. The results of this study not only help to select hospital design scheme, but also optimize the operation control strategy of ventilation system, so as to strengthen the control of infectious diseases and reduce the threat of cross-infection of respiratory infectious diseases to public health safety during peak periods in hospitals..
