  This study not only improves the emergency response strategies for urban residential fires, but also provides customized fire safety policies for different urban environments, effectively reducing fire risk. Through the introduction of resampler technology and interpretable machine learning, this study not only improves the prediction accuracy of the model, but also enhances the transparency and interpretability of the model, providing a more scientific and reliable tool for fire risk management..
