 The innovation of this study is to reveal the passive optimization potential of commercial complex thermal performance in winter through coupling analysis of multi-spatial parameters. The research results not only provide a scientific basis for architectural design, but also provide a new idea for realizing low energy consumption and high efficiency architectural design. The thermal performance of commercial complexes can be significantly improved by optimizing the spatial parameters, thus reducing the dependence on active heating systems and reducing operating costs and carbon emissions.
