 This study uses a single fiber optic sensor to achieve dynamic prediction of different physical fields, and expands the application range of fiber optic sensors to monitor gas and visibility fields in commercial building fires. This not only improves the level of fire monitoring, but also effectively reduces the cost of equipment. It provides effective data support for planning individual evacuation routes and firefighter rescue arrangements, further ensuring personnel safety.
